It takes too much to please me
Attached, but no real feeling
High-fives and corporate anthems
Nothing comes to mind

Kite marked for true low standards
Where more wants all and no less
Just change with no real progress
Nothing comes to mind
I want higher
Still nothing comes to mind

Give me a low five
'Cause I can't help myself
I'm a low five downsize no-one else
Do you love yourself?
These altered states and egos
Potential less than zero
Found god in San Diego
Nothing comes to mind

Give me a low five
'Cause I can't help myself
I'm a low five downsize no-one else
Do you love yourself?

I half-expect to find myself
In full control of nothing else
Last hope, but learned to hope less
Nothing comes to mind
I want higher
Still nothing comes to mind

Give me a low five
'Cause I can't help myself
I'm a low five downsize no-one else
Do you love yourself?
Give me a low five
'Cause I can't help myself
I'm a low five downsize no-one else
Do you love yourself?
